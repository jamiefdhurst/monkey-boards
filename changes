0.4

* Got search working! ;-)
* Removed defunct styles; left with simply 'default' only
* Removed temporary compiled files from 0.3.8 release; stops error
* Handles error when include/engine/compiled is not writeable
* Set correct chmod on files (hopefully?)
* Added some 'cancel' button to various page -> still need to clean this up!
* Various minor bug fixes and cosmetic errors
